## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 11 or newer):


```
git clone https://github.com/ang-lex/spring-petclinic-rest.git
```
in main directory
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-postgres.yml up
docker buildx build --tag spring-petclinic-2.7.0 .  
docker run spring-petclinic-2.7.0
```

You can then access petclinic API here: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/)
